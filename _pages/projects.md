**Multi-Scale Spatial Data Clustering and Visualization**<br>

Spatial datasets, such as tweets in a geographic area, often ex- hibit different distribution patterns at multiple levels of scale, such as live updates about events occurring in very specific locations on the map. Navigating in such multi-scale data-rich spaces is often inefficient, requires users to choose between overview or detail information, and does not support iden- tifying spatial patterns at varying scales. In this paper, we propose TopoGroups, a novel context-preserving technique that aggregates spatial data into hierarchical clusters to im- prove exploration and navigation at multiple spatial scales. The technique uses a boundary distortion algorithm to mini- mize the visual clutter caused by overlapping aggregates. Our user study explores multiple visual encoding strategies for To- poGroups including color, transparency, shading, and shapes in order to convey the hierarchical and statistical information of the geographical aggregates at different scales.
