**Multi-Scale Spatial Data Clustering and Visualization**<br>

<p class="dsp" style="overflow: hidden;">Spatial datasets often exhibit different distribution patterns at multiple levels of scale, such as live updates about events occurring in very specific locations on the map. Navigating in such multi-scale data-rich spaces is often inefficient, requires users to choose between overview or detail information, and does not support identifying spatial patterns at varying scales. We propose TopoGroups, a novel context-preserving technique that aggregates spatial data into hierarchical clusters to improve exploration and navigation at multiple spatial scales. The technique uses a boundary distortion algorithm to minimize the visual clutter caused by overlapping aggregates. Our user study explores multiple visual encoding strategies for TopoGroups including color, transparency, shading, and shapes in order to convey the hierarchical and statistical information of the geographical aggregates at different scales.

**Real-Time Location-Based Social Media Visual Analytics**<br>

<p class="dsp" style="overflow: hidden;">The number of microblog posts published daily has reached a level that hampers the effective retrieval of relevant messages and information, while the volume of data from services such as Twitter is still increasing. Analysts require new methods for monitoring topics of interest, identifying trends and anomalies, and dealing with the data volume and its dynamic nature. It is of particular importance to provide situational awareness for decision making in time-critical tasks. SMART provides end users with scalable and interactive social media analysis and visualization
through topic extraction, combination of filters, cluster examination, and stream categorization. These components are tightly integrated into a highly interactive visual analysis workbench, which allows end users to observe, supervise, and configure the methods in each individual analysis process.

**Visual Analytics of Multiple Scales and Information Dimensions in Social Media**<br>

<img style="float: left; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px;" src="/images/EV16-teaser.png" width="300" />

<p class="dsp" style="overflow: hidden;">Real-time microblogs can be utilized to provide situational awareness during emergency and disaster events. However, the utilization of these datasets requires the decision makers to perform their exploration and analysis across a range of data scales from local to global, while maintaining a cohesive thematic context of the transition between the different granularity levels. The exploration of different information dimensions at the varied scales remains to be a non-trivial task. We present a visual analytics situational awareness environment that supports the real-time exploration of microblog data across multiple scales of analysis. We classify microblogs based on a fine-grained, crisis-related categorization approach, and visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of multiple categories by coupling a spatial lens with a glyph-based visual design. We propose a transparency-based spatial context preserving technique that maintains a smooth transition between different spatial scales. To evaluate our system, we conduct user studies and provide domain expert feedback.
