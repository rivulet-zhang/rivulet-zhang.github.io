Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Prof. David Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd) at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/).
Previous, I received a bachelor's degree in computer science from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/) in the State Key Laboratory of CAD &amp; CG. I spent several weeks in [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in 2012, working with [Prof. Ben Watson](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/bwatson) on Large-Screen Visualization.
