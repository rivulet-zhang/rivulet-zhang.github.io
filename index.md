Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Prof. David Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd) at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/). I work as a research assistant at [Purdue/DHS Visual Analytics Center of Excellence](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/).
Previous, I received a bachelor's degree in computer science from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/) in the State Key Laboratory of CAD&amp;CG. During my undergrad study, I focused on large-scale graph visualization and meteorological data visualization. I was a summer research intern at [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in 2012, working with [Prof. Ben Watson](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/bwatson) on large-screen text visualization.

My research interests lie in the general areas of visual analytics, information visualization and computer-human interaction.
Please check out [Projects](/projects.html) and [Publications](/publications.html) for more information. <br>

My previous &amp; current research includes:

Visual Analytics:
<ul>
<li>Spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-scale clustering, anomaly detection)</li>
<li>Streaming data and situational awareness (e.g., real-time social media, dynamic networks)</li>
<li>Text and document data (e.g., topic modeling, word embedding)</li>
</ul>

InfoVis and CHI:
<ul>
<li>Geospatial visualization (multi-scale navigation and interaction, context preservation)</li>
<li>Text visualization</li>
<li>User-centric visualization design and evaluation</li>
</ul>
